# Chai Garam Newsletter
    
    (I will rewrite the step properly later, any help will be appreciated)

    You will need:-
    1. Desktop
    2. Internet

    Steps to use:-
    1. Make pythonanywhere account and open a bash console on it.

    2.Git clone this project in the pythonanywhere account.

    3.Open **chaigaram.py**  and search for TODO

    4.Edit the data , besite TODO
        ie ADD API keys and tokens and change the file names to the full length actuall file names
        and you are good to go

    4.5 Repeat step three for **cg_03.py**
    
    4.75 Setup your google account to send emails through it 
      Google now requires you to use an “App Password“. 
      This is a 16-digit passcode that is generated in your Google account and allows less secure apps 
      or devices that don’t support 2-step verification to sign in to your Gmail Account.
    
    5.host the website using python anywhere as a python flask project.
        you can go to the web option, choose a flask as template and name the webapp as chai garam , choose the latest python and the pythonanywhere website should create a hello world webapp for you.

        Now you can copy cg_03.py to the flask python file provided.

    6. Test the chaigaram.py by running it once to see if it works or not.

    7. schedule the chaigaram.py

    


    Websites:-
    1.RapidAPI - You will need a RapidAPI account for the quote of the day API
    2.newsapi.org - You will need a API key from here also to actually get the news
    3.pythonanywhere.com - You will need a account here for to schedule the mailing function and to host the website which will have the news as cards



    Notes:
        On laptop, on cards webpage, sliding right shows next card and sliding left opens the current card in a new tab. But on mobile where ever you slide new tab wont open.Its not a bug , its a feature.
